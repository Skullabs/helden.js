## HeldenJS
A very tiny and non-intrusive MVVM library.

## Objective
HeldenJS is just a proof-of-concept library. Its main goal is show that is possible to develop a JS library that:
* Does not hide code from developer
* Does not obfuscate the HTML with unneeded meta-data
* Does make easy for designers change the HTML code without hurt the JS logic
* Does not execute magic code to make lazy-developers' life easy, but makes the UI slow

## About the name
Besides the fact of Helden means "heroes" in German, HeldenJS is a tribute name to my son Helden.
Daddy is so proud of ya, son!

## Examples
There is two simple examples at "samples" folder. It is a good start point.

## Contributing
There is no intent to make this library an uber all-in-one solution. It will be small and I think its design allows
developer to extends HeldenJS with a lot of components. Any contributions are welcome. Just make sure to keep the core
small.
